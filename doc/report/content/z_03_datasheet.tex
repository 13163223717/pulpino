\chapter{ASIC Datasheet (Imperio)}

% If you have designed an \gls{asic} during your work, you should
% include a datasheet for your chip into the report. As soon as you
% start testing your fabricated chip, you will be glad to have such a
% datasheet. An example structure of such a datasheet is given in the
% following. For more inspirations on what you may include in your
% datasheet, have a look at the datasheet of a commercial \gls{ic}.

\section{Description}


\section{Packaging}

A QFN40 package is used with 6 power pins.

\section{Bonding Diagram}

The extended power (ep) bonding is used for this chip. The clock pin is placed on the recommended position in order to facilitate the already manufactured tester boards in use at IIS.

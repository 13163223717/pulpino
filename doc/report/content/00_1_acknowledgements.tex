\chapter*{Acknowledgements}


This work would not have been possible without the great help of my supervisors Frank G\"urkaynak and Michael Gautschi whom I want to thank for all the support they provided me. In addition I want to express my gratitude to Professor Luca Benini for always keeping track with my project and giving valuable input when I needed it. Last but not least I want to give my deep appreciativeness to the entire PULP group and especially to Andreas Traber, the ''father of \pulpino'', who has been always more than willing to answer all my questions and has been a great source of help and advise when I needed it.

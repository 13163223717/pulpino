\section{File Structure}
Describe how the project directories/files are organized, e.g.:

\begin{flushleft}
\dirtree{%
.1 /.
  .2 README \DTcomment{A README with some general information about the project.}.
  .2 01\_report \DTcomment{The source files of the project report.}.
  .2 02\_presentation \DTcomment{The source files of the presentation.}.
  .2 03\_designflow \DTcomment{Some designflow-specific files.}.
}
\end{flushleft}

What needs to be done to run an RTL simulation (stimuli generation,
compilation...)?


\section{Datasets}
If you have a data set comprising several test images, you could
depict and describe them here. Use a simple naming scheme such that
you can easily refer to certain elements of this data set in the text.


\section{More Evaluation Results}
If you conducted an extensive evaluation you could move surplus
graphs/results to the appendix.


\section{Algorithms / Tables}
Large algorithm boxes and tables may clutter your chapters and impair
the readability. If they are not very important, consider moving them
to the appendix as well.
